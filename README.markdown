# An EoCS Assembler in Racket

This repository contains the starter code and documentation to guide students through writing an assembler for the assembly language described in Nisan and Schocken's [The Elements of Computing Systems](http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/).

# For Students

This is not a solution. Instead, it is a set of files and tests that support the writing of an assembler in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/). 

# For Instructors

If you are teaching EoCS, and are interested in using this material in your class, please feel free to contact me, and I can provide you with a completed assembler. As this may be used in future assignments, my request is that the full assembler not be posted or shared publicly.
